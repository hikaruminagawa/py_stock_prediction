# AAPL Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook `aapl_stock_predic_ml.ipynb` which implements a machine learning model to predict the future stock prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL).

## Overview

The notebook uses historical data of AAPL stock prices to train a machine learning model. The model is then used to predict future stock prices. The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques in the field of finance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Open the `aapl_stock_predic_ml.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
4. Run all cells in the notebook.

## Implementation Details

The notebook is divided into several sections:

1. **Data Loading**: In this section, we load the historical data of AAPL stock prices.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Here, we preprocess the data to make it suitable for training the machine learning model.

3. **Model Training**: In this section, we train the machine learning model using the preprocessed data.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Here, we evaluate the performance of the trained model.

5. **Prediction**: In this section, we use the trained model to predict future stock prices.
